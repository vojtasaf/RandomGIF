# RandomGIF

This app uses GIPHY API to display a random GIF.

In order to use it you will have to get an API key here: https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/

Then create a config.js file with the following contents:

`var config = { apiKey: <API_KEY>, };`

Finally replace `<API_KEY>` with your API key surrounded by double quotes ("").
